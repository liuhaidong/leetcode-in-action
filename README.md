# leetcode-in-action
The java code sample for resolve the leetcode problems. 
A good submission should consider not only correct how to calculate result,
but also high performance, low memory consumption.
The basic rule before writing code:
1. do not use recursive functions, it will use too many memory.
2. reduce while loop inside another one, the complex will be $O(n^2)$
3. for number related operations, avoid converting to string then split it to
to array, it's low efficiency. Try to use mod operation or other bit operation.
